This repository contains solutions to all assignments that are part of the 
'FP_workout' repository. In addition, at least one Gast test file should also 
be present, if sensible (work in progress). 

The Exercises folder for the students is generated from this repository.
Any piece of code or comment that they should not see can be placed between

  //>?TEXT AFTER THIS DELIMITER IS COPIED UP UNTIL AND INCLUDING THE NEXT NEWLINE
      anything on further text lines is erased up until and including the closing delimiter:
  //<?

Include instructive text for the students after //>? if applicable. The goal is that
all modules can be compiled. This is not always possible, typically when students have
to create their own data type (implementations).
