To install SoccerFun on a Windows machine:

(1) You need a Clean 2.4 distribution. You can download this for 
    free at:

        http://wiki.clean.cs.ru.nl/Clean

(2) Unpack the Clean 2.4 distribution. 

(3) In the Clean 2.4 distribution you find the CleanIDE.exe and a number 
    of directories: Config, Examples, Help, Libraries, Temp, and Tools.
    
    Move the unpacked SoccerFun distribution to Examples. 

    After this action the Examples folder of your Clean distribution should
    contain a SoccerFun folder with the following content:

    Examples\
        ...
        SoccerFun\
            doc\
                EN\
                    About SoccerFun.pdf              // powerpoint slides that highlight part of SoccerFun (English)
                    About SoccerFun.pptx             // powerpoint slides that highlight part of SoccerFun (English)
                    quickstart_SoccerFun.pdf         // more detailed overview of SoccerFun (English)
                NL\
                    Over SoccerFun.pdf               // powerpoint slides that highlight part of SoccerFun (Dutch)
                    Over SoccerFun.pptx              // powerpoint slides that highlight part of SoccerFun (Dutch)
                    quickstart_SoccerFun.pdf         // more detailed overview of SoccerFun (Dutch)
                Installing SoccerFun on Windows.txt  // the document you're reading right now
            src\
                afbeeldingen\
                Game\
                Gui\
                sound\
                StdLibExt\
                StdReferee\
                StdTeam\
                SoccerFun.env                        // see step 5 below
                SoccerFun64.env                      // see step 5 below
                SoccerFun.icl
                SoccerFun.prj                        // see step 6 below
    

(4) Run the CleanIDE. If it is the first time that you run it, it will ask you 
    if it can integrate itself in the Windows system. 
    Choose "Yes" if you want this, "No" if you want to defer. 
    Note: choose "Never" only if you are very certain about this, 
          because it means truely never.

(5) In the CleanIDE choose the command "Environment:Import...".
    On a 32bit Windows machine, direct the file selector dialog to 
       SoccerFun\src\SoccerFun.env 
    and import the environment.
    On a 64bit Windows machine, direct the file selector dialog to
       SoccerFun\src\SoccerFun64.env
    and import the environment.

    This will set the default paths for the compiler.

    You need to do this only once for your Clean distribution. 

    This step was successful if the CleanIDE has added "SoccerFun" to its list of
    environments (command "Environment").

(6) In the folder StdTeam you find a sparring team, created by Marc Schoolderman, that you can play against:
    - Team_Harmless32.zip
    - Team_Harmless64.zip
    On a 32bit Windows machine, unzip Team_Harmless32.zip; on a 64bit Windows machine, unzip Team_Harmless64.zip.
    - In both versions, you find a file Team_Harmless.dcl. Move it to the StdTeam folder.
    - In both versions, you find a Clean System Files folder, containing Team_Harmless.abc. Move the folder to the 
      StdTeam folder. If you already had a Clean System Files folder, then the file Team_Harmless.abc will be moved
      into that folder.
    
(7) Now you can open (command "File:Open...") the project file at 
    Examples\SoccerFun\src\SoccerFun.prj.

(8) Make sure the Environment of the CleanIDE is set to "SoccerFun".
    Do this with the command "Environment:SoccerFun".

(9) Bring the project up to date with "Project:Bring Up To Date".
    Now all modules are compiled and an executable is created.
    The executable can be launched with "Project:Run".

    Note that "Project:Update and Run" combines the latter commands.

(10) If all went well, Soccer-Fun should have started. Have fun!
